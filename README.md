In this paper, a Python-based machine learning program works and makes predictions of gene function motifs using the GO ontology and resources obtained from online databases containing the genome sequences of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The appropriate model and data enable the prediction to be possible. The algorithm is in deep learning technology and available libraries for support. The work used GTF, Fasta, CSV, and MS Excel files. The computer resources were at the level of an ordinary laptop available, with an eleventh-generation Intel I7 processor and sixteen gigabytes of RAM. The results obtained and the recall and F1-score statistics suggest that the script performs optimally but is still suitable for modifications to improve performance. The hypothesis that the work addresses is valid and feasible.
